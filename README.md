## What do you find here

REST API who implements:

+ Repository pattern: Best way to isolate the access to the data.
+ Read/Write services: Instead of provide direct access to the repository to controllers we create two services to read and write. In further updates we will have a Unit of Work pattern to centralize and manage these operations instead.
+ Entity Framework: Code first.

## Future implementations

+ JWT: Implement JWT to manage authorization.
+ Dockerize application: Always Linux ^^
+ Vue.js app: Create new simple application to provide access to the API.
